# LunarLandingsRocketFuel
Lunar Landings overhaul mod changes rocket fuel item to a liquid from solid. While this makes sense, it also removed the ability for it to be used on trains, cars, tanks, furnaces and other stuff that use chemical fuel. For that, i have readded the solid rocket fuel back. You should probably not download this mod if you want to play Lunar Landings the intended way Xorimuth wanted.
Normal rocket fuel recipe (in lunar landings) gives 10 liquid rocket fuel, and 10 rocket fuel gives 1 solid rocket fuel in a mk2 or mk3 assembly machine. So it's the old vanilla behaviour.
I thank Xorimuth and factorio discord server for helping me with lua.
